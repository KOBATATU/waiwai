# ðŸ˜„ waiwai

waiwai means, in Japanese, let's have "clamorously" and have fun together. "waiwai" is an open-source system for hosting data science competitions. This system is modeled after Kaggle, the most popular platform for data science competitions. However, when companies want to hold private competitions using their internal data and limit participation to their employees, data policy issues inevitably arise. While Kaggle makes it easy to host competitions, some companies find it difficult due to data policy concerns (such as the challenge of uploading company data to Kaggle). Therefore, by reflecting this system open-source, we aim to enable companies to upload this OSS on their own cloud infrastructure and host competitions.

In other words, waiwai is about having fun with their employees in the company.
